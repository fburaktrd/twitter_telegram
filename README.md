# Telegram Bot

This bot able to make you aware when someone tweeted.
Before you use this bot you have to get API keys from twitter and create a bot from telegram. (https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)

Note !
->I did not use a database for telegram users's ids. Instead of this I used a txt file (ids.txt) as a database.
